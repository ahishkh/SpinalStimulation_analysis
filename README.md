# SpinalStimulation_analysis
EMG Signal Processing and Analysis of Spinal Stimulation Effects: Data from three participants includes EMG responses from eight lower-limb muscles across stimulation sites (T11/12, L1/2, combined) and intensities. Visualizations should show peak responses with statistics, reflecting segmental activation patterns noted by Sayenko et al. (2024).
